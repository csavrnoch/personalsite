    <h1>Why I made this website</h1>
        <p>Have you ever searched for a better way of defeating a boss?
        Have you ever wondered what kinds of secrets may be lurking deep in a dungeon?
        How about that tough boss you just couldn't figure out the secret of its demise?
        If you answered "yes" to any of these questions you're not alone.
        That's why I made this website, because I was just like you.
        I wanted a place that I could go to find out information and share things that I've learned.
